        <p>I have been a highly experienced football coach with over 15 years of coaching experience at both amateur and professional levels.  I have a passion for developing young talent and helping players reach their full potential. Many people has known me for my innovative coaching methods and ability to build strong, cohesive teams. I have coached at several football clubs, including london United and Sydney fc and has been credited with helping to develop some of the top players.</p><br>
        <p>During my childhood there were not enough opportunities and chances for me to grow as there was not a great culture for football back then as a result i could not achieve my dream . My family was also not very rich we used to live in a rented rooms my father and mother used to work all day and night for our family survival so i couldn't afford to pay fees for learning football at coaching institute . Even now many childrens are not getting proper food proper education and ofcourse not enough opportunities and i know i cannot provide all those mentioned above but the least i could do is help them learn football with free of cost</p>
