        <ul>
          <li><strong>Running:</strong>  I am also an  avid runner who  enjoys participating in marathons and other races.
          I have always  believed that staying in shape is essential for both physical and mental health.</li>
          <br>
          <br>
          <li><strong>Hiking:</strong> Definitely I  also enjoy hiking and exploring the great outdoors. In free time I  often take my family on weekend hikes and camping trips to get away from the hustle and bustle of city life.</li>
          <br>
          <br>
          <li><strong>Reading:</strong> In my  free time, I  enjoy reading books on sports, history, and philosophy.  I believe that reading is a great way to expand one's knowledge and gain new perspectives.</li>

    </ol>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>Watching football matches: As a football coach, watching football matches can be both a hobby and a professional interest. It allows us to keep up with the latest tactics, player performances, and team strategies.

Playing video games: Some football coaches enjoy playing football video games as a way to relax and unwind. This hobby can also be a fun way to study different formations and tactics.

Running or cycling: I  enjoy staying active outside of their coaching duties. Running or cycling can help coaches stay in shape and relieve stress.

Fishing or hunting: For me who enjoy spending time outdoors, fishing or hunting can be a great hobby. These activities provide an opportunity to connect with nature and unwind after a long day of coaching.</p>
